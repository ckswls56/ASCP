## Python Packages for Reinforcement Learning
### Using requirements.txt
1. Enter your local environment or virtual environment (Python 3.8 or higher).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the ASCP/main directory.

### PyTorch - CUDA 11.8

## How to Train a DQN Model
1. Execute `DQN.py`.
2. Enter the date of the input file (e.g., 201406). The name of the input file must be `ASCP_Data_Input_{date}.xlsx`.
3. Enter the number of episodes to run.
4. Enter the execution ID (e.g., 20240704-1).
5. Episode rewards and time logs will be saved in the logs directory.
6. The best model will be saved in the models directory whenever it is updated.
7. The final generated pairing will be saved as a CSV file in the output directory.

## How to Evaluate a DQN Model
1. Execute `DQN_eval.py`.
2. Enter the date of the input file (e.g., 201406). The name of the input file must be `ASCP_Data_Input_{date}.xlsx`.
3. Enter the number of saved model's episodes.
4. Enter the execution ID of the saved model (e.g., 20240704-1).
5. The evaluation pairing generated by the trained model will be saved as a CSV file in the eval directory.
